Starting from this spring until this summer I partecipated at an online bootcamp about blockchain and smart contract programming promoted by [ConsenSys Academy](https://consensys.net/academy/){:target="_blank"}.

It was an educational experience that has definitely enriched my knowledge about the blockchain and smart contract programming.

It was a good mix between theory and practice, you can see my final project in my portfolio section.
