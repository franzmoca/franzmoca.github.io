### Project Description

I partecipated in HackFS a two week hackathon organized by EthGlobal.

We created a proof of concept to experiment with payment streams linked to real world events.

It was a fun experience working with an international team split between 4 different timezones.

You can watch a demo video of our work and read a detailed description [here](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/hackfs2021/rhadapay).

I mainly worked on the integration with Superfluid, a payment streaming protocol, developing a smart contract that increased or decreased the amount paid every second in response to some offchain events.
