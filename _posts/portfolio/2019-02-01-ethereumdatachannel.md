### Project Description

Study and development of a scaling solution for dApps based on Ethereum blockchain.

This project uses Metamask integration for authenticate two users that want to interact between each other in a safe way.

A proof of concept has been tested and consist on a chat and a simple battleship game. 

The project is being developed to become a full state channel solution based on WebRTC p2p communication for developing decentralized applications.
