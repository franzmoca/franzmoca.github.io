### Project Description

For my bachelor thesis I developed an application to track the flow of bitcoin transactions.

I dealt in particular with the backend part of the application: the data scraping from the blockchain to load the data about bitcoin transactions in a graph database.

The final result was a visual analysis tool focused on forensics transaction analysis.
