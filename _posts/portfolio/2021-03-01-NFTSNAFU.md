### Project Description

I am collaborating with an Italian collective of artists experimenting with NFTs.
I developed part of the [NFT marketplace](https://app.nftsnafu.org) and the [smart contract](https://github.com/SNAFU-Collective/snafu-smartcontracts) for the project deployed on a public blockchain, xDaiChain.


The project also has a DeFI component: each NFT can be converted with an ERC20 token ($SNAFU) according to his rarity.
