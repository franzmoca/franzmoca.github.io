### Project Description

Universal Plot is a Wolfram Mathematica package developed for the Computational Mathematics exam.


His main feacture is the function "sonification", or in other words the ability to create a sound that can uniquely describe a given function.
It can also be used to provide a textual description of the plot of a function.

Both these features can be useful for blind people to improve learning mathematics.

The package is a wrapper of the [Math Description Engine](https://github.com/benetech/Inactive-Math-Description-Engine), a Java library developed by Nasa for the MathTrax project.
