### Project Description

I developed a single page application that was used in the development of an CCG card game prototype designed by Martino Chiacchiera and Michele Piccolini.

The application allowed the creation of decks by hovering your cursor on cardimages.  The tool was useful for enforcing deckbuilding limits according to the game rules.

After creating a deck, it was possible to export the decklist in text format compatible with an online CCG playground (UnTap), allowing more convenient playtesting.
