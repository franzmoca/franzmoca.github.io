### Project Description

I developed an ERC721 token smart contract for a growing startup that deals with verification of authenticity of purchases, such as jerseys worn by football players.

The basic ERC712 smart contract capabilities were extended to allow the storage of additional information directly on the blockchain and an access control system was implemented to differentiate three different types of users.

A web application to operate the smart contract and a wallet mobile app were also developed.
