### Project Description

I developed an ERC721 token smart contract for a rising startup providing clothing supply chain.

The basic ERC712 smart contract capabilities were extended to allow the storage of additional information directly on the blockchain and an access control system was implemented to differentiate three different types of users.

A web application to operate the smart contract was implemented while a mobile app is in development.
