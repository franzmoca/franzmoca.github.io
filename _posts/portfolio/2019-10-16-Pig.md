### Project Description

For my master thesis I studied the scalability issues of blockchain-based applications. 

Starting from my Ethereum Data Channel project, I implemented a state channel solution applicable to two player games.

My solution allows games with randomness thanks to an optimized commit-reveal scheme and just requires two transactions to be made on chain in the optimal case for the whole game: only if the players don't agree on updating the game state there is the need to interact with the blockchain used as judge.

The smart contracts are designed in a modular way: to create new games you just need to implement the smart contract that enforce the game rules according to a specific interface.

After some code cleanup I intend to publish my state channel solution in a public repository.
